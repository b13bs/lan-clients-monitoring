# wireless-clients-monitor
Periodally scan a network subnet to detect potentially unknown clients and notify admin

TODO
* write README file
  * dependencies: python modules, linux packages, host permissions
  * rationale
  * config.py
* do not create a new token if one already exist in the database
* create a Jinja file with buttons created dynamically with token values
* abuse of config.py file
* create token file if does not exist (first run)
